Future plans:
	* introduce enhanced machine statictics including:
	  + counters for items in and items out
	  + biogas used counter
	  + ice counter for compactor
	  + pipe connection status for freezer
	  + usage: ticks running, ticks standby, ticks blocked, total ticks etc
	  and evaluate possible expansion of SaferLua controller '$commands' with
	  functions to read and reset above fields
	* Tubelib Chest Indicator - small attachable plate that indicates fill level
	  of connected Tubelib Chest
	* Metal Recycler - decomposing device to retrieve metal ingots, Mese shards
	  and Diamonds from all items and nodes that were crafted from these resources;
	  device will return random number of ingots and shards - between 1 and craft
	  quantity; Mese crystals will be converted to shards for calculation purposes;
	  fuelled by moderate volume of Biogas; robust recipe parser is required for
	  this device
