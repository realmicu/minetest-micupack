biogasmachines:
	* Gasifier - move unified_inventory recipe registration to
	  add_gasifier_recipe() function (like Compactor)

future plans:
	* Biogas Torch - crafted from glass, biogas and steel ingot (that gives 8)
	  replacement for default coal torch; should use the same model and mechanics
	  but modified textures (metal box, blueish light)
	* Tubelib Chest Indicator - small attachable plate that indicates fill level
	  of connected Tubelib Chest
	* Metal Recycler - decomposing device to retrieve metal ingots, Mese shardsxi
	  and Diamonds from all items and nodes that were crafted from these resources;
	  device will return random number of ingots and shards - between 1 and craft
	  quantity; Mese crystals will be converted to shards for calculation purposes;
	  fuelled by moderate volume of Biogas; robust recipe parser is required for
	  this device
