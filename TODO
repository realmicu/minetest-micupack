make remaining Biogas Machines compatible with Tubelib2:
	* compactor

change slprogtools:
	* read "tubelib_number" instead of "number" metadata
	* add support for 'func' code

change furnacemonitor:
	* read "tubelib_number" instead of "number" metadata

tubelib -> tubelib2 tasks:

0. Affected mods: biogasmachines, slprogtools, furnacemonitor

1. Biogasmachines - change formspec:
   * parameters are : formspec(self, pos, meta)
   * all metadata info taken from meta parameter now
   * button image : self:get_state_button_image(meta)
   * drop show_icon parameter, always show icon hints

2. 'running' metadata changed to 'tubelib_state'

3. 'number' metadata changed to 'tubelib_number'

4. tubelib.statestring() --> State:get_state_string(meta)

5. Remove machine_(stop|start|standby|fault) helpers

6. countdown_to_idle() -> countdown_to_halt()

7. state_meta_reset() helper

8. Add helpers for can_dig, after_place_node

9. on_receive_fields(), on_recv_message()

10. on_timer: new fuel check; fault and blocked states with re-entry;
    exception check for item cont. etc

future plans:
	* Biogas Torch - crafted from glass, biogas and steel ingot (that gives 8)
	  replacement for default coal torch; should use the same model and mechanics
	  but modified textures (metal box, blueish light)
	* Tubelib Chest Indicator - small attachable plate that indicates fill level
	  of connected Tubelib Chest
	* Metal Recycler - decomposing device to retrieve metal ingots, Mese shardsxi
	  and Diamonds from all items and nodes that were crafted from these resources;
	  device will return random number of ingots and shards - between 1 and craft
	  quantity; Mese crystals will be converted to shards for calculation purposes;
	  fuelled by moderate volume of Biogas; robust recipe parser is required for
	  this device
