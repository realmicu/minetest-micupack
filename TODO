	  combinations possible through custom recipe registration; requires cooling
	  water - in buckets, via pipeworks or frozen into ice cubes
	* Metal Recycler - retrieve metal ingots and Mese shards from all items
	  and nodes that were crafted from these resources; device will return
	  random number of such items between 1 and craft quantity; Mese crystals
	  will be converted to shards for calculation purposes; Biogas will be
	  moderately used
