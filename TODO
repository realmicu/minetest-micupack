	* consider custom naming of copier dongle the same way book gets titled
	  so device can be stored and treated as archive copies for software

moderntables:
	* add half-height table
	* add table with storage (2x8)

biogasmachines:
	* Coal Gasifier, Biogas Smelter - behaviour based on Quarry and Grinder
	* Freezer - machine to produce ice cubes from water (either in buckets
	  or provided via pipeworks)
	* Coal Gasifier - convert coal block to Biogas stack, do not use Biogas
	  ("electric") as it would create split loop complications in automated
	  processing; leftover is gravel? dirt? none?
	* Biogas Smelter - furnace powered by Biogas
	* High-Temp Compressor - heat up cobblestone using Biogas and change it
	  (slowly and with lot of energy) to obsidian; also compress coal block
	  to diamond using the same technique; make other combinations possible
	  through custom recipe registration; allow quicker work by providing
	  cooling water via pipeworks
