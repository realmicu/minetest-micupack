smartlcassistant:
	* add an USB-dongle-like device similar to programmer
	* device works only with Smartline Lua Controller
	* it gets init(), loop() and notes text (metadata) and
	  saves them in memory
	* additionally it works like programmer - collect IDs of devices
	  and produces simple lua code 'var = "id"'
	* reset at using at nothing/non-lua
	* transfers code to device metadata when left-clicking

moderntables:
	* add half-height table
	* add table with storage (2x8)

biogasmachines:
	* Coal Gasifier, Biogas Smelter - behaviour based on Quarry and Grinder

furnacemonitor:
	* add

obsidianmaker:
	* general idea: heat up cobblestone using Biogas and with help of water
	  input (pipes?) convert to obsidian block;
	  should require a lot of energy
