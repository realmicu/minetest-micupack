biogasmachines:
	* High-Temp Compressor - heat up cobblestone or compressed gravel
	  using Biogas and change it (slowly and with lot of energy) to obsidian;
	  also compress coal block to diamond using the same technique; make other
	  combinations possible through custom recipe registration; requires cooling
	  water - in buckets, via pipeworks or ice cubes


future plans:
	* Tubelib Chest Indicator - small attachable plate that indicates fill level
	  of connected Tubelib Chest
	* Metal Recycler - decomposing device to retrieve metal ingots, Mese shardsxi
	  and Diamonds from all items and nodes that were crafted from these resources;
	  device will return random number of ingots and shards - between 1 and craft
	  quantity; Mese crystals will be converted to shards for calculation purposes;
	  fuelled by moderate volume of Biogas; robust recipe parser is required for
	  this device
	* Portable Biogas Torch (optional, TBD) - a tool to melt down ice and produce
	  water source from it
