Minetest modpack, tested with version 0.4.17.1.

This modpack contains:

* Modern Tables
  Simple wooden tables. To be expanded.

* Miner Tools
  Electronic gadgets for professional miners. Inspired by mod called 'Mineral Detector'.
  This mod provides following portable devices: 
  - geothermometer - shows temperature variations of solid blocks (water and lava
    affect block relative temperature - water cools it down while lava warms it up);
    useful for underground mining to search - or avoid - flooded caverns or lava pools
  - mineral scanner - shows ore count in area around player, selectable range (designed
    to be a handheld, improved version of Mineral Detector mentioned earlier)
  - mineral finder - short range directional scanner to find nearby deposits of selected
    mineral; very picky, especially at angles, but driven by simple logic
  - all-in-one versions of above devices, each one with improved characteristics

* SaferLua Programming Tools
  Devices for interacting with SaferLua Controller from TechPack mod. To be expanded.
  For now it contains a Memory Copier - portable dongle to transfer code between SL
  Controllers in much simpler and faster fashion than copying it with text books; please
  note that due to formspec nature, only inactive tabs can be populated - before code
  upload change active Controller tab to 'outp' or 'help'.

* Biogas Machines
  Work in progress, only a stub for now. Planned to expand TechPack with biogas-fuelled
  furnace, machine to extract biogas from coal blocks and a high temperature compressor
  to convert (albeit slowly) stone to obsidian.
